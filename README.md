hJOPandroidDriver is a simple application, which allows user to become an
engine driver and control one or more engines on the model railroad. It fully
cooperates with [hJOP](http://hjop.kmz-brno.cz) (in Czech). Importantly,
hJOP is required for this application to work.

Application connects directly to the main hJOPserver via WiFi and requests
engines from railroad dispatchers.
